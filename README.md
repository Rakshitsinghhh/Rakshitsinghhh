> The legacy one: <https://leetcode.card.workers.dev/>

### Options

There are many options, you can configure them by passing a query string to the endpoint.

#### `site` (default: `us`)

Data source, can be `us` or `cn`.

#### `font` (default: `Baloo_2`)

Card font, you can use almost all fonts on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

It is case-insensitive, and you can use `font=dancing_script` or `font=Dancing%20Script` to get the same result.

```md
![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?font=Dancing_Script)
```

[![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?font=Dancing_Script)](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?font=Dancing_Script)

#### `width` and `height` (default: `500` and `200`)

Change the card size, it will not resize the content.

But it will be helpful if you want to use custom css.

```md
![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?width=500&height=500)
```

[![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?width=500&height=500)](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?width=500&height=500)

#### `border` and `radius` (default: `1` and `4`)

Change the card border and radius.

```md
![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?border=0&radius=20)
```

[![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?border=0&radius=20)](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?border=0&radius=20)

#### `animation` (default: `true`)

Enable or disable the animation.

```md
![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?animation=false)
```

[![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?animation=false)](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?animation=false)

#### `hide` (default: `""`)

Hide elements on the card, it is a comma-separated list of element ids.

```md
![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?hide=ranking,total-solved-text,easy-solved-count,medium-solved-count,hard-solved-count)
```

[![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?hide=ranking,total-solved-text,easy-solved-count,medium-solved-count,hard-solved-count)](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?hide=ranking,total-solved-text,easy-solved-count,medium-solved-count,hard-solved-count)

#### `ext` (default: `""`)

Extension, it is a comma-separated list of extension names.

NOTICE: You can only use one of extended-card extensions (`activity`, `contest`, `heatmap`) at a time now, maybe they can be used together in the future.

> Animation, font, theme, and external stylesheet are all implemented by extensions and enabled by default.

```

[![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/lapor?ext=heatmap)](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/lapor?ext=heatmap)

#### `cache` (default: `60`)

Cache time in seconds.

Note: it will not be a good idea to set it to a long time because GitHub will fetch and cache the card.

```md
![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?cache=0)
```

> You can make `DELETE` request to `/:site/:username` to delete the cache.

#### `sheets` (default: `""`)

External stylesheet, it is a comma-separated list of urls.

You can upload your custom CSS to gist and use the url.

```md
![](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/jacoblincool?sheets=url1,url2)
```

They will be injected in the order you specified.

#### Legacy Options

Still work, but deprecated.

| Key             | Description                  | Default Value |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| `border_radius` | Same as `radius`             | `4`           |
